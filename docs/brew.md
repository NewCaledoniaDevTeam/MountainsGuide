By placing one or more bottles in the lower three slots of the brewing interface, an ingredient in the upper slot, and blaze powder in the fuel slot, you can distill the ingredient into each bottle and brew potions which may be consumed to grant an effect to the player.

#### Brewing Process

Every potion starts with a water bottle, made by filling a glass bottle at a water source or filled cauldron. Using blaze powder, the next step is to add a base ingredient to create a base potion, usually nether wart to create an awkward potion. By brewing an effect ingredient into the awkward potion in the same manner, the player can create a potion with a working effect.

A modifier ingredient (glowstone dust or redstone dust) may be added to make the effect more intense or last longer or change the effect entirely. Gunpowder can be added to a potion at any stage to convert it to a splash potion, which can be thrown (or fired using a dispenser) to affect all players and mobs in a radius. Dragon's breath can be added to a splash potion to convert it to a lingering potion, which can be used to create a cloud which grants an effect as long as it remains. Each brewing step takes 20 seconds.

Each piece of blaze powder used provides fuel for brewing 20 batches of potions. Fuel is consumed when a brewing operation starts; it is not recovered if the operation is halted prematurely by removing the ingredient or potion bottles.

### Brewing Ingredients

#### Base Ingredients and Modifiers

Base ingredients are ingredients which can be added directly to a water bottle and are the starting point of all potions. Nether Wart is the most fundamental of the base ingredients, as it is required to make the vast majority of potions.

Modifiers are ingredients used to alter the properties of a potion, or to change a potion effect into a different one. The fermented spider eye is unique in that it is the only modifier that can convert a water bottle directly into an effective potion.
